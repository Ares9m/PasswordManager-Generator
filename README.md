# Password Generator & Menager

This is my first project, my objective was to create a password generator and password menager with GUI.
To run the app run main.py
The generator will generate each symbol only once for your password. You can still edit your passwords.
The menager saves your passwords on your computer and in the future it will encypt and decrypt them for viewing.
Right now everybody would just see all logins if they open passwords.txt.

The encryption key lines and inputs do nothing for now.
