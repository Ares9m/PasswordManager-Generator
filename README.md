# PASSWORDGENERATOR

This is my first project, my objective was to create a password generator and password menager in one app with GUI and data encryption.

The generator will generate each symbol only once for your password. You can still edit your passwords.
The menager saves your passwords on your computer and in the future it will encypt them using your key that you would have to remember.
It's best to use just one key for all your passwords as there is no way to get your key back if you forget!

Work in progress, the last remaing step is to add data encryption system.
the encryption key line edits do nothing, it's for future use.

DO NOT USE IT, everybody would just see your logins if they open passwords.txt
